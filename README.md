# resumeQuick

This is a Node.js web page that displays my resume. I will be updating it with some effects, relevant information, and design updates.

The server currently responds to a http request and with an HTML template literal snippet. It also supports light or dark mode based on your system preferences.

To start the server, run `npm start`, and then go to `localhost:3000` to view the page.
